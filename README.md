# bingo

This and the entire app/repo is currently very much WIP.

## Purpose
A fairly simple, RoR sandbox & demo app to try out new technologies and demonstrate coding ability to prospective employers.

## Overview
A customizable, interactive, web-enabled Bingo game.

## Initial Design/Technology Goals
 * use the latest Ruby and Rails versions
 * incorporate authentication and authorization

## Goals for future improvements and fun
 * use containers
 * incorporate RSpec (just because it's popular, not because it's necessarily needed)
 * add a RESTful API to return JSON (as opposed to using ERB template views)
 * create SPAs using a JS framework like AngularJS or React or Ember... and probably use TypeScript
  * SPAs will be bootstrapped with a Rails controller and view, but interact with the API
 * create a new repo with a mobile app using this API
 * add i18n and l10n (maybe)
